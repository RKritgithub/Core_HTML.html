    <p>Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites and web applications. It involves front-end development for the user interface, back-end development for server-side logic, and often full-stack development covering both aspects. Developers use programming languages, frameworks, and tools to build and deploy websites on the internet. Responsive design ensures that sites work well on various devices.</p>
